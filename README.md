This project utilizes a computer vision model to detect emotions from video feeds in real-time. Using the `FER` (Facial Emotion Recognition) library, the application captures video from the webcam, analyzes facial expressions, and displays the detected emotions along with their confidence levels.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection using a webcam feed.
- Displays dominant emotions with confidence scores.
- Supports multiple face detection in the same frame.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## Technologies Used


- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks, used for capturing video and processing frames.
- **FER**: A library for facial emotion recognition, used to identify emotions from facial expressions.
